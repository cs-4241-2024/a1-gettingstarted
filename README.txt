-node server.js (ask her why mine isnt working)
modify server.js to point to these


In this assignment I added information that tells you more about me, my background, and my experiences. I styled my page using css styles by encorporating text-align, font-family, font-size, color, font-weight, and background-color. I addede an animation on the top of the screen so when you click the rotate image button, the image rotates. I referred to this page to learn how to do this: https://plainenglish.io/blog/javascript-rotate-image-ad2f05eafeb2 Additionally, I created a color palette and implemented all the colors in my webpage, which I added to this.
