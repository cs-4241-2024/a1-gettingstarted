I added a header, footer, image, link, and table.
I animate the image moving to the right using a JavaScript stopInterval function specifying the direction, tick speed, and distance.
I added the Roboto font to the body that I found on Google Fonts.
I added five style rules which were background color, font family, margins, padding, and color.
I created an adobe color pallet and used it.
