This project introduces who I am, my background, education, skills, and experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I used custom CSS to style the entire page, making it visually appealing:
- **Color Palette**: I created a consistent color scheme using CSS variables. The colors used include --color-light-gray, --color-beige, --color-brown, --color-dark-brown, and --color-gray. 
= **Typography**: I applied the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts for a clean appearance.
- **Page Layout**: I structured the page using <header>, <main>, and <footer> elements. 
- **Image Styling**: I added styles to the image, including a fixed size and padding, and set up a transition effect for the hover animation.

## JavaScript Animation
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
- I added a hover effect to the image to make the page more interactive. When hovering over the image, it fades to 30% opacity, and when the mouse is removed, it returns back.

## Semantic HTML Tags
- I used the following tags in my HTML file
- <header>: Wraps the main heading 
- <main>: Contains the core content of the webpage.
- <section>: I used this to divide the content into sections like "Information", "Experience", "Education", and "Skills."
- <footer>: Contains a copyright notice and closes the page.
-<ul> and <li>: Used for listing the courses I've taken.

## Design
- **Custom Color Palette**
  -I created a color palette using Adobe Color and applied it throughout the site using CSS.
