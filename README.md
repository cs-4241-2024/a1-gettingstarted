### Project Overview
This project is a simple portfolio webpage, showcasing educational background, work experience, and internships. The webpage is styled with a custom color palette, uses a Google Font, and includes a basic JavaScript animation.

### CSS Enhancements
1. **Background Color**:
   - The background of the body is set to `#F2AA79`, giving the page a warm, welcoming tone.

2. **Header Styling**:
   - The header has a background color of `#DEC90B` and features white text. It is centered and has rounded corners for a smooth look.

3. **Main Content**:
   - The main content section uses a border color of `#D91C84` and a background color of `#E63E79` with white text. The content fades in with a smooth transition when the page loads.

4. **Section Headers**:
   - The headers for sections like "About Me" and "Experience" are styled with the color `#F457FA` to create contrast and highlight the sections.

5. **Table Styling**:
   - The table headers have a black background with padding for readability.

6. **Footer Styling**:
   - The footer uses the color `#D91C84` with white text and features a link styled with the color `#F457FA`.

### Google Font
The webpage uses the **Roboto** font family, which is imported from Google Fonts. The link to include this font is:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100;300;400;500;700;900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### JavaScript Animation

A simple JavaScript animation is implemented that fades in the main content of the page upon loading.
The opacity of the content is initially set to 0, and it transitions to full opacity over 2 seconds once the page has loaded.

### Semantic HTML Tags Used
The webpage utilizes various semantic HTML tags to structure the content effectively:

- header:  main title and navigation links.
- main: wraps the main content of the page.
- section: divides  content into logical sections.
- nav: navigation links within the header.
- table: puts work experience in a table
- footer: has the footer information, including a link to LinkedIn.

- #DEC90B (Yellow)
   - #D91C84 (Magenta)
