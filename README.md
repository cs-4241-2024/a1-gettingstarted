This project shows a simple webpage detailing some information about myself. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, figure, img, body, and video selectors. Some p tags were centered, text within li was turned italic, the img was given a set max width, figure was centered and given text color, body was given a gradient background.

- **Used other HTML tags**: Used <figure> to wrap the <img> and <figcaption> tags, used <link> to link a stylesheet, used <br> to create a line break space, 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
