This project shows a simple website. It contains some basic information about me as well as some details about my technical background

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I set the background color of the page to a soft gray to create a neutral base for the content. 
The main heading h1 is styled with a warm color. It is also centered. This helps to draw attention to the title of the page. 
Additionally, I added a top boarder to the subheadings h2 to seperate the section from other content.
