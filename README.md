This project shows a webpage with information about Matthew Neuffer. It includes are variety of experience that Matthew Neuffer has, split into different categories.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for headers, the experience boxes, links, footer, and body. For each of the sections, I applied a color from my pallet, trying to keep a heirarchy and keep the page readable. I applied the open sans font. I used margins and padding to give the text and content space, so they dont conflict with the boarders or each other. For the page content, I centered and applied a max-width. This helps keep the content in a more readable layout that doesnt spread to the whole screen. On the boxes that hold the experience information, I added a border, and a border radius to round the edges.
- **Added simple JavaScript Animation**: Added animation where the header of the page slides in from the top, on page load. To see this animation, as it happens rather quickly, refresh the page.
- **HTML tags**: Added tages for links (for connecting to example content of the projects), footer (email link and name), div (experience boxes), images, and headers (h1, h2, h3).

### Design Achievements
- **Used OpenSans Font from Google Fonts**: Applied OpenSans to my site as the primary font.
- **Used Color Pallet from Adobe Color**: The Hex codes for the colors used are the following #3C4359, #1F43BC, #58BED9, #CEECF2, #F2E63D
