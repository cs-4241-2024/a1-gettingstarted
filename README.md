This project shows a website containing some information about me, both corresponding to the class and about my hobbies and goals.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body to set it to Inter font with a weight of 300. Also made body's background a color from a generated palette. Added colors to h1, h2, h3, p, p1, and li from said palette. Made h1, h2, and h3 bolder by giving their fonts a greater weight.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Inter Font from Google Fonts**: I used Inter as the font for the text on my site. I also utilized its custom weights to make my headings appear bolder than the rest of the page.
- **Used the Color Palette from Adobe**: I utilized all the different colors in the palette I generated on my website. Each heading is a different color, the text and list elements are different colors, and the background is a color from the palette I generated and included in my repository.
