This projects is a simple webpage that shows my basic information, programming experience, and
classes. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules and classes for the p, h1, table, th, td, and div. Created
hover states for the div card and for the table. For my style rules I created a div banner for the top and bottom of
my page. I also added shadows to these banners. I then created a nested div that held all of my information. In this
nested div I created it to become a card and have a shadow on it as well. It also has a hover feature that makes the
shadow darker and also picks the card up from the page. I also made my table look nicer by styling it and also adding
a hover feature.
- **Sematics HTML Tags**: Table, Footer, Header, Unordered List, Div, 

### Design Achievements
- **Created a Color palette using color.adobe.come**: Took all the colors on my webpage added the color palette to my
repo
- **Used the Lora Font from Goolge Fonts**: I used the Lora as the font for my webpage.
