This project is the first assignment for WebWare. To complete this assignment, I had to work with HTML< CSS, and Javascript to create a simple webpage. 

The Project includes the following files:
- index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the webpage.
- style.css: The CSS file that provides styling for the webpage, including layout, typography, and colors.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the webpage, specifically an animation triggered by clicking a green box.
- server.js: The Node.js server file that serves the files and handles HTTP requests.
- linkone.html: A secondary HTML file that users are redirected to when interacting with a green box on the main page.

## Technical Achievements
**Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, li, and a selectors...
Color Palette: I created a custom color pallete using Adobe Color. The palette has the colors:
- #FAD911: Background color.
- #575BFA: Main text color.
- #3DD1DB: Primary accent color (used for headers and the footer background).
- #25DB2F: Secondary accent color (used for the animated box).
- #FF6FFF: Highlight color (used for links and subheadings).
  
Style Rules I used:
- Body and text color were set to ensure readability.
- Headers and footers were styled with the primary color, ensuring a consistent look.
- The table was styled with borders and alternating colors for rows.
- The animated box was styled to change size and color on hover.
- Links were styled with hover effects to enhance interactivity.

**Added JavaScript Animation**
- Bounce Animation: I used a basic bounce animation on the green box on the main page. When the user clicks the box, it "bounces" before redirecting the user to another page('linkone.html'). I did this with JavaScript to add and remove CSS classes that would trigger the animation.

**Used Semantic HTML Tags**
- Header, Footer, and Navigation: Semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, and <nav> were used to structure the main sections of the webpage.
- Sections and Articles: The <section> and <article> tags were used to group related content, such as the "About Me" and "Experience" sections.
- Figure and Figcaption: The <figure> and <figcaption> tags were used to properly associate images with their captions.
- Unordered List: A list of my hobbies and interests were displayed as bullet points using the <ul> and <li> tags.

### Design Achievements
**Custom Color Palette (10 points)**:
- I created a custom color palette using Adobe Color and applied it for my website. I used different colors for different elements, such as background, text, headers, and interactive elements. The color palette ensures that the user was focused on what was on the screen. 
**Google Font Usage**
- Font Used: The "Kanit" font from Google Fonts was used throughout the website. I chose the font because it looked modern and slightly different from common fonts 
- Font Application: The font was applied to all text elements, with different font weights (300, 400, 600) used to be distinguished.
