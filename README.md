This project shows a little bit about me, as well as some experience I have with HTML and CSS.
I added some extra personality to my page, but also wanted to keep it quite simple. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: 
  - Added CSS animation to h1, changing colors on an alternating reverse cycle. 
  - Changed the background color of the page, as well as color of tables and text. 
  - Added two tables and customized with CSS. 
    - Tables customized differently for the seperate parts. 
  - Added the CSS animation of the cat in the footer. 

Each of these were challenging as most were new features I haven't worked with before.
The CSS animations were really exciting to get to work with, and the learning required to understand the settings of animation.
The cat was added for a bit of personality in the page. I found the GIF on Google (checked and it was free to use.), and then looped the animation so the cat walks along the page.
The other added CSS was for decoration and to make the page easier and more inviting to look at. 

- **Added HTML Tags**:
  - footer used to have the gif of the cat at the bottom of the page. 
  - links added to import the Google Icon. 
  - img used to import the gif of the walking cat. 
  - tables used for listing classes I've taken at WPI as well as the experience in the following coding languages. 
  - style and @image used for importing the Google Font Nunito Family.

### Design Achievements
- **Used Google Fonts**: Added Nunito font family through Google Fonts to my page. 
- **Used Google Icons**: Added the Heart icon to h1. 

Added the Nunito font family that I found on Google Fonts. I chose this font because I think it complimented the soft colors used on the page.
The Google Icon heart was added next to my name for more design, and a bit of personality.
