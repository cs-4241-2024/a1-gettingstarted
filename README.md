This project is a one-page Node.js site that includes a Node server script, index.html file, and a CSS stylsheet. The site showcases using CSS to style elements, serving files to the client with Node, and incorporating multiple HTML elements.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, title header, table, avatar image, and footer.
- **Designed CSS animation triggered with JS**: Clicking the avatar image in the title will trigger a CSS spin animation.
- **Used additional HTML tags**: Included a footer, links for my portfolio and LinkedIn, avatar image, and a table for my experience.


### Design Achievements
- **Added font from Google Fonts**: Added the Poppins font family to the body using the link tag in the HTML header.
