This project shows a simple webpage displaying some information about myself. Information included is my name, class, major and minor, CS courses completed, and my level of expereience with several technologies and methods. A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is also demonstrated by implementing different semantic HTML tags and CSS rules.

### Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, table, th, td, li, and p selectors. The rules for body changed the background color, the text color, and the font. The rules for table, th, and td added solid collapsed borderes with a 2px width; 4px padding was also added alongside a large font size and text being center aligned. The rules for li made the font size large and changed the font style to italic. The rule for p made the font size large.
- **Used other semantic HTML tags**: Used the semantic tags table, tr, th, td, and img. Table, tr, th, and td were all used to create the table listing the different technologies and methods and my experience with each one of them. Img was used to insert the WPI seal at the bottom of the webpage.

### Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette for the webpage**: I used a two-color complemetary color palette for my webpage. #F0FFFF for the background color and #2E8080 for the text color.
- **Used the Alegreya Font from Google Fonts**: I used Alegreya as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
