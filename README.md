Achievements

Below are some suggested technical and design achievements.

## Technical Achievements
1. I styled my page with CSS using many different style rules. To name a few, I used style rules including color, font size, alignment, positions, and more. 
2. I added a simple JavaScript animation which features a card that can be clicked to turn around on the screen. I followed a Youtube video and added my own personal flair to it. 
3. I experimented with different HTML tags; to name a few: paragraphs, underline, lists, image, and headers. 

### Design Achievements
1. I've included the color palette I used for my website in this Github repository. (colorpalette.png)
2. I used the Overlock font I found in Google fonts and imported it using an embed link. 

Thank you!
