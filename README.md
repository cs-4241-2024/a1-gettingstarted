## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: changed the body background color, font, and font color. Changed the paragaph text alignment to center and did not need to change the color or font since that was already modified by body. Changed table, th, and td to make the table larger and add an outline. Changed h1 to have a different color. This overrides the color selected by body since it is more specific. Changed h2 to be aligned to center and have a different text color.
- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: I made the title shift from the left to the center of the screen.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I used table to dispaly my skills

### Design Achievements
- **Create a color palette**: created a color pallet of 4 colors and used one color for the background, one color for the main title, one color for the sub-title, and one color for the text.
