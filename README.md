## Technical Achievements
1:I applied various CSS rules for different elements, including p, li, and a selectors, to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the page.
2.The navigation bar (nav) is designed to be responsive and visually engaging, with hover effects on links using pseudo-elements (::after).
3.Background and Header Design
4.I implemented hover effects on navigation links with smooth transitions. The ::after pseudo-element creates an animated underline effect on hover, enhancing user interactivity.
5.The layout is designed to be responsive, using flexible box (flexbox) layouts for the navigation bar and other components, ensuring that the page looks good on various screen sizes.
6.An animated box (.animate-box) is included in the main section that can be manipulated via JavaScript (script.js), adding a dynamic element to the page.
7.I included a logo (images/logo.png) and a portrait image (images/portrait.png).
8.I added links images header footer ,navigate bar
