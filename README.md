This project is a simple website talking about my background and experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for body, td, th, ul, and a hover rule for li.
- **Added a simple JavaScript Animation**: Animated my name to get lighter and darker over time.
- **Used semantic tags to create a table**: Created a table for language experience, which required use of the table,
thead, tbody, tr, th, and td tags.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Lato Font from Google Fonts**: I used Lato as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
