This project is a simple webpage that has a little bit of information about me and my coding experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, p, li, h1, h2, h4, and h5 selectors.
  - **Added Flexbox**: Made the website a little responsive by introducing flexbox for visual
    formatting reasons.

### Design Achievements
- **Applied a Color Palette**: I used the background image to generate a color palette that was applied to all text elements.

- **Used the Montserrat Font from Google Fonts**: I used Montserrat as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
