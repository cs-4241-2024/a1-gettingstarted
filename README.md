## Technical Achievements
1.I applied various CSS rules to enhance the visual presentation of the webpage. 
The styles include:
Header and Footer: Customized the header and footer to have distinct colors and fixed positions
Buttons: Styled the buttons with a black border, hover effects, and animations.
Tables: Styled tables with borders and spacing for better readability.
Main Image: Added a border and shadow to the main image, with a scaling animation effect.
Popup: Styled the popup overlay and content for better visibility and user experience.

2.I implemented a JavaScript-based animation for the main image. The image scales up and down continuously, providing a dynamic visual effect

3.I used various semantic HTML tags：
header: Contains the main title and introduction.
main: Encompasses the primary content of the page.
footer: Provides copyright information.
table: Displays a list of courses in a tabular format.
a: Used for the contact button to link to a contact page
