This project shows a brief overview of me including my hobbies and academic career at WPI. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Used 5 new tags**: img, div, footer, a, and header tags were all used
- **Javascript animation**: fade the background colors within the color pallete mentioned in Design Achivements

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color pallete**: (as seen in WebwareA1ColorScheme.png) based on some of my favorite colors and implemented CSS sheets based off 
that color scheme. All colors were used either once or multiple times, two were used in the background animation mentioned in Technical Achievements
