This project deomstrates my ability to use HTML and CSS to make a simple webpage.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I used CSS rules to center the body of the webpage using margins if the display screen is over 800px. I set the max-width of all images to be 100% (in case I add more images, or someone accesses my webpage on a device smaller than 800px). I also added a border and drop-shadow to the cat image, and made the image width 50% of the screen size (minus the margins). Lastly, I adjusted the font size of the image caption and centered it under the image.
- **Experimented with semantic tags**: I added an image of my cats and a link to my LinkedIn page.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Tiny5 and Source Code Pro Fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Tiny5 as the font for the two most important headers and Source Code Pro for the remainder of the text.
- **Used a color palette made with Adobe**: I made a color palette using Adobe and applied it to my webpage with CSS. A screenshot of the color palette is in the 'img' folder.
