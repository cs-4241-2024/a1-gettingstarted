#### This project shows a simple about me website that has information on my classes taken and work/technology experience

## Technical Achievements
### Styled page with CSS: 
I added multiple style rules to categorize different formats of information:
- body rule to change the background
- h1 rule to style the header
- h2 rule for subsections
- p2 rule for complete sentences
- p3 rule for bullet points
- p4 rule for sub-subsections
I did this as a part of the color wheel pallette portion. I used what I learned in class leading to not much difficulty

### Experiment with other semantic HTML tags: 
I added a link for my linkedin
This was quite simple, I used google and found that it was easy to add hyperlinks

## Design Achievements
### Created a color palette using color.adobe.com. I chose the colors because I liked how they looked
The screenshot of the pallette is in this repo in file Color Wheel.png
This wasn't hard, I just used the default settings and moved it to colors that I liked.
I had to change one of the colors to be more white in order for it to be a better background color

### Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts: 
I used robot for all of my fonts.
The website you provided with all the google fonts had a great tutorial on how to do this making it simple
