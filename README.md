## Technical Achievements
- **Styled elements with CSS**: Added rules for the p, h1, h2, body, and a selectors as well as individual elements for styling and spacing. 
- **Styled layout with CSS**: used divs and other spacing rules to use part of an image so the animation would work. This was the hardest part of the entire project. It's still not perfect as, if you refresh while moving the curser, all the elements will slowly creep left. 
- **created frosted glass look**: styled the box that held the main text to have that frosted pane look that's so hip and trendy these days
- **Animated background Image**: image moves in waves as you move your curser around the window. It's just a couple waves, but in one draft it was moving in opposition to the curser. Would that have garnered more points?

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as a font for all of my A tags. 
- **Created and implimented a color pallete**: using the image I wanted to use, I created a basic pallete along with highlight and shadow corrosponding colours in [Figma](https://cdn.glitch.global/1758074e-64d8-4ae8-b906-1c9734b00b6e/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20060442.png?v=1724925938278)
- **Easter Egg**: if you make the window in a more portrait aspect ratio, you can see Prior in my lap :)
