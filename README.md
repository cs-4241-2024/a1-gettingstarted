This project shows an initial website about me, with various small technical and design changes.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the body, h1, h2, p, li, and footer. The bulk of the changes are in the body, where I set the background color, default text color, font, and font size. The body also makes the entire site display as a column down the middle, with regular text having a max width and left alignment to look like a paragraph. h1 and h2 change the header color and size, bolds them, and for h1 specifically center aligns it. p has some padding added to bodies of text, while li removes the bullet points in my experience list. The footer is bold and italicized, has a different color, is center aligned, and has padding. The most challenging part of this by far was figuring out how to configure the display and flex direction to make everything look center aligned without just using text-align and making it look ugly.
- **Experimented with other HTML tags**: I used <img> to display a small WPI logo as my <header> above the rest of the site. I also used a <footer> to display my name again at the bottom in different colored text. Figuring out how to get the image to appear at a reasonable size and styling the footer differently than the rest of the site were the most challenging parts of this.

### Design Achievements
- **Created and used an Adobe color palette**: My color palette has 5 colors: #AA3939, #FF0000, #553939, #E2E2E2, and #1D1D1D. This challenged me to add more elements to use all of the colors. These colors are used in the background, main text, both headers, and the footer.
- **Used the Lato Font from Google Fonts**: I used Lato for all of the font on my site. The only challenging thing about this was making text bold or italic.
