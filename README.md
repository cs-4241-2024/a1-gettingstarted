This project shows my competence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows I know how to use the HTML tags, style using CSS, and implement a basic animation using JavaScript to create a simple website.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I changed the `<ul>` tag to be squares instead of bullet points. I also changed the font of the "Rubik's cubes" text to a custom font called Kablammo. 
- **Add a simple JavaScript animation to the page**: I used a simple Javascript animation to make the text "Rubik's cubes" rainbow and transition between colors.
- **Experiment with other semantic HTML tags**: I used the `<marquee>` tag for the first text to make it look fun. I used the `<a>` tag to link to a Github repository that I created. I used the `<strong>` tag to provide emphasis to the companies that I worked for. I used the `<img />` tag to display a picture of myself. I used a `<span>` tag to create a container for the text "Rubik's cubes", to make it easier to identify for JavaScript to animate. I used the `<math>` tags to display the quadratic equation.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Kablammo Font from Google Fonts**: I used Kablammo as the font for the "Rubik's cubes" text. I wanted to pick a really unique font, but didn't want to make my site unreadable.
