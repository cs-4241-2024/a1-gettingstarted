This project shows my name, my graduating year, the CS courses I have taken, and my experience levels in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Unit Testing, and is a website hosted on Glitch

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: added the following seven classes in stylesheet.css: baskervville-sc-regular, first-color, second-color, third-color, fourth-color, fifth-color, sixth-color. I am not entirely sure if these count as 'rules' but figured there was a chance.
- **Used an image semantic tag to display the image of the color wheel**: Color wheel picture is shown using the <img> tag

### Design Achievements
- **Used the color palate comprised of the colors #B4D948, #52D95C, #7ADA49, #D6D285, #71D99B, #A8D98F**: These colors were applied to the corrosponding text under the 'Extras' 'usage of color palate' entry, and the image of the color wheel was placed above
- **Used the Baskervville SC from Google Fonts**: I used Baskervville SC as the font for all text in my site.
