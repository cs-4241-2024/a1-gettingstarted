This project shows a webpage I created. It has three pages implemented, an About me, Home, and Color pallet. The color pallet shows the colors I chose to use within the website. The about me has a picture of me and a little bit about who I am. The home page is simply there to guide the user. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I added rules that changed the color of my heading 1, 2 and paragraph text. I added a background to the page. I used CSS to change the font of all my text. I changed the size of the page and the background color. I gave my image on the about page a border, margins and width.
- **Added a simple JavaScript animation**: I added a Java Script animation that changes the image size in the about me page. The image increases and decreases when the text "Image Size?" Is hovered over.
- **Experimented with other *semantic* HTML tags**: I used links to create different pages. I used an image to show who I am. I used a table to have my text to the right of my image. I used a header to display the links to the other pages. I used a header to display a link to the other pages. I used a footer to display the course and my name.
