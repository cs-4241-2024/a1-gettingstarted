This project shows a simple webpage with information about me, a background animation, a color palette, and some fun JavaScript shenanigans. The page is styled with a custom font and a color palette that I generated using an online tool. The background animation was created using a CSS tool that I found online.

## Technical Achievements

* Styled the page with CSS, a custom font, and a color palette.
  * Added rules for most elements on the page, including:
    * `html` - sets the font size and background color
    * `-webkit-keyframes` - sets the animation for the background
    * `p` - text size, position
    * `ul` - list style, position
    * `li` - text size, position
    * All other HTML identifiers, such as `#about`, `#courses`, `#experience`, and `.section`, have rules that set the font size, position, and padding.
* Used JavaScript to add a button that does something fun with the page and the DOM.
* Used other semantic HTML elements, such as `ul`, `li`, `div`, `hr` and `strong`.

## Design Achievements
