This project shows information about myself and my computer science experience.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: p, li, and ul are sized to 20px. h1 and h2 are sized to 35px. 
The body has a grey background while p, li, and ul have a lightgreen background. 
h1 is pink and h2 is light blue. table, th, and td all have a 1px black border. 

- **Moving table animation**: I changed the tables left margin every 50ms with a script. I also added a 0.5s transition ease with CSS to make it smoother. 

- **Added HTML tags**: I added the header tag and the table tag. 

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used bold and italicized Roboto for h1 and h2 and thin Roboto for the rest of the text.
