Nandita Kumar, Webware Assignment 1 - Hello World: Basic Deployment w/ Git, GitHub, Glitch
===
- This project shows the specified information about me against an animated background. *Please make sure to open the Glitch in a full-sized window in order to properly view all features of the site.*

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the html, div, h1, section, a, and p selectors as well as for multiple custom ID selectors and varying cases.
- **Implemented a JavaScript animation**: Used the HTML canvas, CSS styling, and a JS animation script to create a continuously moving, color-changing background by repeatedly drawing, clearing, and redrawing a bit larger a shape in a cycling array of colors (my Adobe color palette).
- **Included other semantic HTML tags**: Used the link, script, img, canvas, footer, and nav tags on the site.

## Design Achievements
- **Created and utilized a color palette**: A screenshot of the palette can be found [in this repository](/palette.jpg)
- **Used the Beth Ellen and Calligraffitti Font from Google Fonts**: The Beth Ellen font is used for my name, while the Calligraffitti font is used for the main text.

### Things To Do Still
- turn blobs into sin wave-esque things that are diagonally positioned on the canvas but are moving in the x and y directions (so its like a wave)(this would be so cool but so hard)
- use svgs or something bc things are SO PIXELATED D:
- sometimes buffer between blobs gets finicky (prob line weight for adjacent ones are both big) so they overlap and look jank -- fix this
- FIX MEGABLOB ?? (a bunch of blobs load together at once and are mishmashed tho not janky? just mega) wait yes kind of jank -- just let it run for a while and you'll see
- find out why the bg anim doesn't work when window is smaller (feel like this will be an issue on glitch....)
- figure out how to clear offscreen graphics to save processing power (for now check bottom right corner)
- turn some of the div tags into section tags (idk its buggy when i try now)
