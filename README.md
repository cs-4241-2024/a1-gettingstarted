## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added style rules for the p, body, header, footer, h, ul, and animation container.
                            Modified the font size for the body & p, the font color for most text, and added a background color.
                            I also added an opacity to the main page body, modified the heading for h containers, 
                            the width/height of the animation container, and a color gradient for the header and footer. 
                            Finally, I also aligned text for the table towards the center, made the header table sections italicized and bolded, 
                            and created a border for the header & table contents and another outline for the animation container.
- **JavaScript Animation**: Added a simple moving square to the page that moves down the container and then jumps back to its starting position.
- **Semantic HTML tags**: I created a header and footer, alongside a displayed image on the page. 
                          Plus, I used the section tag to split each portion of text with, added a div tag for the JavaScript animation 
                          and, lastly, created a table with information about my experiences each year at WPI.

### Design Achievements
- **Used an Adobe Color Palette**: The Color Palette used is in the repo.
- **Used the Ubuntu Font from Google Fonts**: I used Ubuntu as the font for all of the text present on the page.
