## Technical Achievements
1. - **Styled page with CSS**:Some style rules I used are "margin-left", "margin-right", "width", "height", "text-align", "float"

2. - **Made a picture rotate as my animation**:My animation is the picture to the right moving when you click the animation button

3. - **Added 5 semantic HTML tags**:I have a table, footer, aside, image, links, and a figure.

### Design Achievements
1. **Made a color palatte**:My color palatte is shown in color_palette.png. 
I have the background as #F0A2E0
I have the header as #8C3BED
I have the body as #523BED
I have the h4 as #3055F0
I have the button as #C63BED
I have the footer as #B78AED

2. **Used Matemasie google font**:I used Matemasie font on the title.

Notes:
For button css styling I used code from my previous HCI (Human Computer Interaction) lab.
Also if you preview without full screen some of the titles start overlapping eachother.
