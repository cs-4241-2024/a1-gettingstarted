This project shows the information about my regarding my name, class, major, previous cs courses, and experience in several topics within computer science specifically web development.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: I did 5 style rules. I won't count the colors because that was part of the design acheivements. For h1, i made the text all uppercase and set the fontsize to 3em. I also put a purple border around it because it's the title. For each paragraph, I separated it by a margin of 30px. For h2, I put a white border around because it's a new section (courses, experiences). For experience topics, I used bullet points as the shape of a circle. Finally I used a table for courses with a black box separating each course. These are my 5 styles rules.

### Design Achievements
- **Created a color pallette from adobe**: I used #dfd5f5 for my background, #ef33f2 for my h1, #b033f2 for the border around h1, #f23386 as the color for p, #cf87f5 as the color for h2, and #ececf5 for the border around h2. Refer to the screenshot titled ColorPallette.png to see the color wheel.
