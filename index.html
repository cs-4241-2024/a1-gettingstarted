    <p>
        I'm a Computer Science student graduating in 2025. At WPI, I've previously taken:
    <ul>
        <li>CS 1102 Accelerated Introduction to Program Design</li>
        <li>CS 2103 Accelerated Object-Oriented Design Concepts</li>
        <li>CS 2303 Systems Programming Concepts</li>
        <li>CS 2011 Introduction to Machine Organization and Assembly Language</li>
        <li>CS 2022 Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>CS 3043 Social Implications of Information Processing</li>
        <li>CS 2223 Algorithms</li>
        <li>CS 3516 Computer Networks</li>
        <li>CS 3431 Database Systems I</li>
        <li>CS 3041 Human Computer Interaction</li>
        <li>CS 3733 Software Engineering</li>
        <li>CS 3013 Operating Systems</li>
        <li>CS 585 Big Data Management</li>
        <li>CS 4120 Analysis of Algorithms</li>
        <li>CS 4233 Object-Oriented Analysis & Design</li>
        <li>CS 4241 Webware: Computational Technology For Network Information Systems</li>
        <li>CS 4341 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</li>
    </ul>

    I've been writing HTML and CSS since I was in middle school, and I've been writing Java since high school, and I
    learned about unit testing within Java when I took CS 2103 Accelerated Introduction to Object Oriented Programming,
    and continued to work on it through taking CS 3733 Software Engineering, CS 4233 Object-Oriented Analysis and
    Design, and my internships.
    <br>
    I taught myself Javascript and Typescript in my sophomore year of high school to work on <a
        href="https://github.com/PorygonBot/bot">Porygon</a>, a Discord bot that autmoatically analyzes Pokemon battles.
    <br>
    My introduction to programming was through an online course released by MIT called 6.00.1 Introduction to
    Programming using Python, and I've been programing with Python ever since. It is my language of choice when working
    on programming problems like Advent of Code or Leetcode, and during technical interviews, due to its flexibility and
    versatility.

    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games (I love Pokemon, the Horizon series, and Hades), watching movies
        (one of my favorite movies of all time is Dune (2021)), and solving
        <span id="rainbow-text" class="kablammo rubiks">Rubik's cubes</span> (my personal best is 6.87 seconds).
