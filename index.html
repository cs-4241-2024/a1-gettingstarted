        <p>
          I am an Indian American from Mumbai, India, though I was born in New York City, NY. 
          I have many hobbies as listed below!
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy coding, solving complex problems, and learning new technologies.
          I also love music and learning new things about it. I like knowing what 
          artist is thinking about while making the music. I also like going to 
          concerts. 
          Travelling is one of my favorite things to do
