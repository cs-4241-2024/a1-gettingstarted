    <h1>Information about Joseph Thesmar</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Joseph Thesmar. Originally from Versailles, France, I moved to the United States because my father was hired to teach at MIT. My passion for programming began in high school when I took the AP Computer Science class, where I became captivated by the problem-solving aspect of the IT world. I saw coding as a complex puzzle with endless patterns and possibilities, which offerd the potential to find, develop, and attribute practical solutions to real-world challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
          I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (Class of 2025). This academic year will mark my final year at WPI. Beginning in Spring 2025, after graduation, I aim to join the workforce. Everything excites me about technology, but I want to specialize in the digital rather than the analog side. I have conducted research using differential privacy methods and completed several internships where I worked on cloud computing, high-performance computing, data analytics and visualization, and building full-stack applications.
      </p>

      <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy running, playing various sports, reading French literature, watching movies and series, hanging out with friends, traveling, and observing celestial bodies.
