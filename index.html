      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML</td>
        <td>I have a very basic / fundamental understanding of HTML. During my student teaching practicum, I taught a high school unit on static webpage development using HTML and a little CSS, but nothing groundbreaking.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CSS</td>
        <td>See above; very basic.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Java</td>
        <td>Was the first language that I learned and shaped the way that I think of programs. I tend to organize most of the work I do into something that resembles OOP as best I can, even when I'm using a procedural language like C (which I use for my job).</td>

        <td>JavaScript</td>
        <td>Zero experience, never used it for anything.</td>

        <td>Ruby</td>
        <td>Also zero experience, if not less because I at least know what JavaScript looks like.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Python</td>
        <td>Not a fan of the language (or dynamic typing as a whole), but I can use it effectively to carry out small projects. If provided the opportunity do do otherwise, I prefer not to use it for larger projects.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Unit Testing</td>
        <td>JUnit testing, mostly, but not much other than that. Used a lot for CS 3733 and 4233.</td>

    <h3>Working Experience</h3>
    <p>
      For the past five summers (since 2020), I have worked as a software / firmware development intern at a manufacturing company that specializes in diesel engine control systems. I primarily write embedded firmware in C for engine control units and would consider myself rather experienced in embedded firmware programming, organization, and some elements of control. I have also been involved in the development of in-house test stand equipment and software written in LabVIEW, Python, and C#.
