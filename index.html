  <p>
    IMGD Major in the Class of 2025
  </p>
  <p>
      Originally from NJ, I heard about WPI from family who live in Massachusetts. I learned about and experimented with Augmented
      Reality in High School, and decided I wanted to pursue it. Seeing the IMGD department at WPI, I thought it would be a good fit.
      I have experience with all sorts of web design, creating websites for a variety of clients and businesses.
